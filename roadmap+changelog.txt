changelog and futureroadmap regarding the program Heidiplot.py
developed for plotting neutron singlecrystal diffraction data taken at HEiDi at the FRMII, Munich

Version 1.0: 
	Todo:
	1. should be assumed bugfree
	2. no obvious additional features need to be implemented

Version 0.3:
	Todo:
	1. undergo betatesting by colleagues and Martin Meven
	2. include proposed changes from betatesting

Version 0.2:
	Todo:
	1. undergo alphatesting by colleagues and Martin Meven
	2. include proposed changes from alphatesting

Version 0.15:
	Todo:
	1. different types of scans can be plotted together <-- need to be provided
	2. include Brillouinzones for the various structuretypes
	3. exception handling for plot configfile
	4. options to enable faster rotation of plots:
		a. show only the xth point
		b. threshold in intensity -> points below get dropped (absolute or relative to max) 

Version 0.14:
	- menu: new plot functionality
	- check if current plot should be discarded
	- orientation mat redefined, because Heidiconfig showed actually a* b* c* which is the real omat
	- Peak (hkl): problems with missing separators solved
	Todo:
	1. exception handling for structure configfile
	2. check on BZ for magnetic and structural unit cell separate
	3. create true unique key for every measurement
	4. give propositions, how to avoid current warning
	5. include A. Glavics propositions:
		1. change background to white: fig.facecolor?
		2. tabbing order for boundaries, could be done with hbox
		4. plot within mainframe
		5. change functions to numpy implementation
		7. define constants globally in caps at beginning of lib
	

Version 0.13: - released 13.3.2012
	- readme including a short manual
	- Button to unload measurements from a single gnuplotfile
	- option to scale plotted points added
	- some design tweaking
	- menubar rewritten: Help added with about and manual
	- docstrings for the library functions
	- comparing to None with "is"
	- functionality of saving and loading complete plots implemented -> in manual
	- open/save: if nothing is selected open/save button should not function
	- update sliderpos after loading
			 
Version 0.12: - released 9.3.2012
	- include various crystal structures (is the formula in umrechMag2c for every type correct?)
	- exception handling for entries in structurevalues, needs to be float convertable and if matrix is consistent with structuretype and length
	- include aStar and alphaStar etc. calculations within 'class crystalStructure' (Betrag von a* = aStar)
	- exception handling for entries in boundaries
	- optimize plotting boundaries h, k and l, if not specified choose +/-hAbsmax, +/-kAbsmax and +/-lAbsmax
	- show Message, if due to boundaries no points are shown
	- minor fixes on omat and angles: internal the correct omat and angles in rad is saved, but user works with omat a* b* c* and angles degrees
	
Version 0.11: - released 8.3.2012
	- commentaries in config file inserted, in order to enable manual alteration
	- any measurements on hexagonal crystals can be plotted
	- orientation Matrix got included
	- changelog and roadmap added

Version 0.1: (State Martin Meven looked at) - released 8.3.2012
	- works with CaBaCo2FeO7
	- plotting options: nuclear Peaks, magnetic Peaks, Brillouinzone
	- export to gnuplotscript
	- plotting boundaries: h,k,l,T
	- save and load configfile for crystalstructure

Thank you for using this program and I welcome any propositions for improvement
